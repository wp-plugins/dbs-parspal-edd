This plugin allows you to add Parspal.com gateway to EDD plugin in a clean way!

== Description ==

As said before this plugin adds a clean ParsPal gate way to easy digital downloads.
I had checked some of the available versions but all of them had some problems even the official version. So I made a clean version with my personal php ParsPal class which is included in plugin and you can use it in your projects.
Some of the features:
* It has both Rial and Toman currencies.
* It is NOT a edition version! It's a made version!
* It sends product names to parspal in the right way!
* It uses payment database record ID for payments ID instead of a random number.
* It Works :D
